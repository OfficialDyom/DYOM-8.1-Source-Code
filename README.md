- Introduction
This GTA San Andreas modification enables GTA fans that have no SCM-scripting knowledge to design their own missions. Missions are designed easy and fast in-game and can be played and distributed.

- Installation
First you have to make sure that CLEO3 is installed. It can be downloaded from http://cleo.sannybuilder.com/
Without CLEO this modification will work, but saving and loading of missions is not supported.
The modification is distributed as an MPACK, which enables you to choose between then normal game and this mod, after you have started GTA San Andreas. Put the map "MPACK" with all content in your "GTA San Andreas User Files" (My Documents). After that start GTA San Andreas, click "New Game" and select "Design Your Own Mission".
