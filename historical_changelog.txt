//                 respect               not coded, always 3 respect for every mission
//            - Add menu for creating/editing triggers, to configure the mission reward
//            - When passed , apply the rewards
//            - When storyline ends, reset riot/maxwantedlevel/ped&carenabled.
//  ToDo:
//  Ideas: 
//    * ?? Create option for saving progress. 
//  Limits:
//    * num of missiontriggers currently limited to 24 due to global storage space.
//
//   open bugs:
//    * finish mission in car crashes dyom
//
//   Ideas: 
//    * take weapons from player
//    * don't die in designmode
//    * statistics menu, that shows number of objectives/actors/etc etc

//
//  Analysis of the pointarray bug...
//  ---------------------------
//  By looking at the "debug" mode on the website into several randomly selected missions
//  I saw that most of them have very illogical use of points and a lot of garbage in the point array.
//  Further inspection shows that several values appear multiple times in the array.
//  Conclusion of much research:
//  Declaration of an array with size > 256 results in declaration of an array size MODULO 256.
//  Thus the arrays of 400 items are reallyu only arrays with 144 items.
//  Using them as 400 item arrays as we do, thus results in partly overlapping arrays, 
//  which can lead to very strange results and very nasty bugs, as the last array (Zcoord), overlaps the 256 global variables following it.
//
//  The impact of the problem was a bit tempered by the fact that we were only intialising the first 200 points to zero, the rest was left 
//  filled with whatever was there. Therefor the upper 200 entries were hardly used.
//
//  Solution: * Just limiting the number of points to 256 is not an option as this will break all of the missions that have been created with 
//            V5 and use paths. In this cae we would have to build in a complex routine, to map as many of the higher points in the new valid range.
//            * Declaring two 200 item array and using them as a 400 item array might work. this will have to be done in combination with initializing all 400 items :)
//
//  Fixed.... that took some time to get them properly in the mem-map  :P

// v When creating an "Actor Objective". If you select the "Health" menu, you are immidiatly taken to the "Select Marker" menu instead 
//       of the health one. This will also happen if you select the "Kill all Enemies" menu.
// v When creating a car (not an objective one), if you decide to abort creating it (via F), the "Ghost" of the car will still remain 
//       behind (vs dissapearing in other versions) and will still appear in the mission. 
//       (Note that this will only happen if you abort the car creation after you have pressed "Y" in the "Move the car into the 
//       right position and press "Y" to confirm" screen. If you abort before this screen, the car dissapears normally.)
// v With the "Add Car" objective, the player will not get out of the car when you press "Y" to confirm the location. 
//       This means that if you want to abort the selection after that part, the car (Not a "Ghost") will still remain on the 
//       field both during design mode AND gameplay.
// v player in designmode is not strong after teleporting
